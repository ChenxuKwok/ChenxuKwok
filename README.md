### Hi there 👋 This is Chenxu Guo's Github

I am `Chenxu Guo`,  a current junior undergraduate from **Zhejiang University**, and a research in tern at the **Berkeley Speech Group**.

- 👀 I’m interested in machine learning, especially speech-related areas such as ASR and TTS.
- 🧠 I'm interested in human-centred AI and aim to manage and use limited or imperfect data efficiently. If you are also interested in this area, please feel free to contact me!
